## Battle Toys

My game for Ludum Dare 38 with the theme "Small World". Made in Unity using Blender and Photoshop for all of my programmer art needs.


## PostDev ##

This branch will be updated until the game reaches a more complete state, more what I had originally intended for LD38, maybe more.
If it becomes something more than that I'll likely start a new repo for it.

## Art

All assets are programmer art. I don't gaurantee sanity when using the .fbx files. I have no idea what I'm doing with them.

## Code

The hacks are stong with this one
