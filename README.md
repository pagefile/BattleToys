## Battle Toys

Post LD38 development branch for my (unfinished) entry. I don't want to just leave it all alone and unfinished :(
The code in this branch is NOT what was used to build my entry for LD38.


## PostDev ##

This branch will be updated until the game reaches a more complete state, more what I had originally intended for LD38, maybe more.
If it becomes something more than that I'll likely start a new repo for it.

## Art

All assets are programmer art. I don't gaurantee sanity when using the .fbx files. I have no idea what I'm doing with them.

## Code

The hacks are stong with this one
